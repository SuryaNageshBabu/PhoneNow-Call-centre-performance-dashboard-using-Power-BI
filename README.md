## Overview

With an objective to cater the needs of PhoneNow, a Call centre that wants to gain insights into their data, I have created a dashboard addressing the Call centre trends. And also considering the inputs from the Call centre manager, I have further included key perforamce indicators and metrics reflecting the performance of the Call centre and its agents. (This Power BI dashboard that I have created here was my proposal to the problem statetment offered by PWC as part of their virtual internship program)

## The Creator's view point

![PhoneNow performance dashboard](https://github.com/SuryaNageshBabu/Surya_Data_Analyst_Portfolio/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-04-23%20114012.png)

- The report is designed with an objective to give an overview of the key performance indicators. I have included Gauge chart which best represents the metric customer satisfaction and have included donut charts to visualize the proportions of categorical metric from the dataset. 

- And in order to get a bigger picture on the metrics with regards to the call centre agents have leveraged the scope of slicing techniques to filter the report based on the agent, similarly the report also enables the user to filer the data based on different issues and dates. 

- Finally the cross referencing filters across the visuals make the report more informative and can aid the user to gain insights on the granular aspects.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about the performance of the Call centre and its agents in terms of customer satisfaction. The data is collected by PhoneNow from their internal repositories.

## Key metrics explored

- **Overall customer satisfaction**
- **Overall calls answered and abandoned**
- **Calls by time**
- **Average speed of answer**
- **Agent performace stats**

## Key insights

- The average customer satisfaction rate for PhoneNow is 2.8, with 5 being the maximum possible score.
- The percentage of calls answered and resolved (over the given period of 3 months) has declined eventually.
- Dan has the highest customer satisfaction ratings amongst all the other agents.
- Conversly it can further be observed that Joe has taken more time in average to answer the customer queries. Further analysis on this aspect could help the call centre to 
  re-access the strategy to interact with the customers.
- Average speed of answer per customer issue is around 54.15 seconds.
